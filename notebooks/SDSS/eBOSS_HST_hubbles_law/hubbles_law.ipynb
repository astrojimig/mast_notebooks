    "## Introduction \n",
    "The Hubble-Lemaître law is one of the most prominent topics of debate in modern cosmology. In 1927, Georges Lemaître published a paper in a Belgian journal proposing that the Universe was expanding, using data from Vesto Slipher at Lowell Observatory. Around the same time, Edwin Hubble was independently studying the relationship between galaxy distances and their radial velocities at Mount Wilson Observatory. Although Hubble was originally credited with the discovery, in 2018 the International Astronomical Union officially renamed \"Hubble’s Law\" to the \"Hubble–Lemaître Law\" to acknowledge Lemaître’s earlier contribution  [[1]](https://pressbooks.bccampus.ca/astronomy1105/chapter/26-5-the-expanding-universe/).\n",
    "\n",
    "The Big Bang occurred approximately 14 billion years ago, leading to the expansion of the Universe. We can estimate the speed of this expansion by examining the redshifts of a sample of galaxies. These redshifts can be translated into radial velocities, and then using observed spectral flux, we can the determine the distances to these galaxies. By plotting radial velocities versus distances, we can apply a linear fit model to the data. This allows us to approximate the Hubble constant from the slope as described by Hubble's Law [[2]](https://www.teachastronomy.com/textbook/The-Expanding-Universe/Relating-Redshift-and-Distance/):\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\n",
    "v_{rad} = H_{0}d\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\n",
    "There are various models used to calculate H<sub>0</sub>, some based on observations of the Cosmic Microwave Background (CMB), and others on measurements of galaxies or supernovae. These models typically yield varying values of H<sub>0</sub> ranging from approximately 67 km/s/Mpc to 74 km/s/Mpc. This discrepancy is known as the *Hubble Tension* [[3]](https://doi.org/10.3390/universe9020094). \n",
    "\n",
    "In this notebook, we'll construct a Hubble-Lemaître Diagram using data from the Sloan Digital Sky Survey’s (SDSS) Extended Baryon Oscillation Spectroscopic Survey (eBOSS). eBOSS gathered over 4 million spectra from stars, quasars, and galaxies. We'll focus on a subset of galaxies, using their redshifts and spectral data to plot radial velocity against distance. By applying a linear fit to this relationship, we can estimate Hubble's constant from the slope of the resulting line."

Astronomers continue to use both local distance indicators (e.g., Tip of the Red Giant Branch stars) and early-Universe probes like the CMB to constrain H<sub>0</sub>, but the Hubble Tension remains unresolved [[7]](https://www.scientificamerican.com/article/the-hubble-tension-is-becoming-a-hubble-crisis/).\n",

Since our H<sub>0</sub> value is based on galaxy observations from eBOSS, it's reasonable that it falls on the higher end of the range, though this could also be influenced by uncertainties introduced by several assumptions:\n",
