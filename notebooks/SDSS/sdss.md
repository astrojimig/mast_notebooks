# Sloan Digital Sky Survey (SDSS)

## What is SDSS?
The Sloan Digital Sky Survey (SDSS) is an international collaboration producing wide-field imaging and high-resolution spectroscopic surveys since 1998. The [SDSS Legacy Archive at MAST](https://archive.stsci.edu/missions-and-data/sdss) is the collection of science-ready SDSS data which is hosted at MAST. This includes images, spectra, catalogs and Value Added Catalogs (VACs) from all public SDSS data releases through SDSS-V.

## For Further Reading
The [SDSS Legacy Archive at MAST User Manual](https://outerspace.stsci.edu/display/SDSS/The+SDSS+Legacy+Archive+at+MAST) website contains summary information, data product overviews, descriptions of MAST tools, and tutorials on how to interact with SDSS data at MAST.

For more general information relating to SDSS, the documentation is available at [www.sdss.org](https://www.sdss.org)
