    "In the early 1900s, most astronomers believed objects such as the Andromeda galaxy were nebulous clouds within our galaxy. In 1923, Edwin Hubble proved Andromeda was outside the Milky Way using the period-luminosity relationship with Cepheid variables [[2]](https://lco.global/spacebook/galaxies/history-discovery/). Once Hubble discovered most \"nebulae\" visible in the sky were actually galaxies, he created a classification scheme known as the *Hubble Tuning Fork*, or the *Hubble Sequence*. Hubble initially separated galaxies into two main groups: elliptical galaxies and spiral galaxies. Elliptical galaxies lack spiral arms, but are ellipses in shape. Hubble classified them by their ellipticity; the more elongated the galaxy, the higher its classification number (i.e. E0 to E7).\n",
    "\n",
    "Spiral galaxies, which have prominent spiral arms, were further divided into two types based on the presence of a central bar: barred spirals (with a bar) and normal spirals (without). Both types were then categorized as early, intermediate, or late, depending on how tightly wound their arms were. Galaxies that lacked both a central nucleus and spiral structure were classified as \"irregular\" [[3]](https://adsabs.harvard.edu/pdf/1934ApJ....79....8H).\n",
    "\n",
    "Hubble initially proposed that galaxies evolved from left to right on his tuning fork diagram, starting at E0 ellipticals and ending at late-type spiral/barred spiral galaxies. However, we now know this to be incorrect! Despite this, the Hubble Sequence remains a widely used tool for galaxy morphological classification [[1]](https://skyserver.sdss.org/dr1/en/proj/advanced/galaxies/tuningfork.asp).\n",
    "\n",
    "In this notebook, we'll construct our own Hubble Tuning Fork Diagram based on this classification scheme using imaging data from the SDSS Legacy Imaging Survey. We can utilize the `Astrocut` package to crop selected fields and generate color cutouts of various galaxies for our diagram. \n"

To do this, the survey took millions of 10 by 13 arcminute pictures (called \"fields\"). Not only does the SDSS Legacy Imaging Survey data at MAST provide users with preview images in .jpg format, but it also has photometric data in all five broad band SDSS filters (u, g, r, i, and z).
