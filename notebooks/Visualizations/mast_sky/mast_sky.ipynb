    "As of July 2025, the [Mikulski Archive for Space Telescope (MAST)](https://archive.stsci.edu) contains nearly *300 million* astronomical observations from over 20 different telescope missions including the Hubble Space Telescope (HST), the James Webb Space Telescope (JWST), and the Transiting Exoplanet Survey Satellite (TESS).\n",

    "\n",
    "MAST is like a library - our collections are open to the public and free of cost. For both libraries and MAST, maintaining a detailed catalog that lists everything in the collection is extremely important to help people find what they are looking for. A library might catalog the book title, author's name, publishing year, and the location on the shelf for every book in its collection. At MAST, we maintain a list of the filenames, the astronomical coordinates, the exposure date, which telescope was used, and so much more, for every single file in the archive. This information is referred to as 'metadata' - important information which describes the contents of every file!\n",
    "\n",
    "At MAST, this metadata catalog is accessible from your web browser using the [MAST Portal](https://mast.stsci.edu/portal/Mashup/Clients/Mast/Portal.html), in Python using [astroquery.MAST](https://astroquery.readthedocs.io/en/latest/mast/mast.html), or using the [Table Access Protocal (VO-TAP)](https://mast.stsci.edu/vo-tap/) service. With this MAST metadata catalog, we can retrieve a huge list of astronomical coordinates for every observation in MAST.\n",
    "\n",
    "For this notebook, we did the hard work for you and have created a file named `mast_obscounts.npz` which contains the observation counts in MAST for every coordinate in the sky. This file was last updated in July 2025. \n",
    "\n",
    "*A Note of Caution:* We do not recommend trying to re-create this file yourself, because MAST contains A LOT of data and the large query will fill up your computer's RAM memory quickly. If you need to perform large queries or want a higher-resolution version of this file, please contact the [MAST Helpdesk](https://outerspace.stsci.edu/display/MASTDOCS/Archive+Support).\n",
